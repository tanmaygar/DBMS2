local-spin mutual exclusion using fetch-and-\phi primitives	2003	proceedings of the 23rd international conference on distributed computing systems	112302	we present a generic fetch-and-\phi-based local-spin mutualexclusion algorithm with o(1) time complexity underthe rmr (remote-memory-reference) measure. this algorithmis "generic" in the sense that it can be implementedusing any fetch-and-\phi primitive of rank 2n, where n isthe number of processes. the rank of a fetch-and-\phi primitiveexpresses the extent to which processes may "orderthemselves" using that primitive. by using an arbitrationtree, a theta(logr n) algorithm can be constructed usingany primitive of rank r, where 2 \le r \
